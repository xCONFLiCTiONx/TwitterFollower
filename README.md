Follow followers of people with the same interests

If you have multiple accounts then you can put this program in a separate folder per account which will save the settings for each directory. The title will display the current directory so you'll know which is which.

This is just a lightweight program specifically for following the followers of other people. Choose someone that has the same interests for optimal targeting.
The database is so that you don't send a follow request to the same person aka abuse prevention.

Twitter may disable your account until you prove you're not a bot and even change your password. This is normal behavior to protect your account. Just run it again after you change your password to keep consistency and all should be fine. This is not abuse and feel free to read the docs for more info.

When your follow limit is reached the program will pop up a message box giving you the message.

You can also follow your own followers which is what this program is most ideal for.
